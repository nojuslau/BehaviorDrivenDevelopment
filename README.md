# Behavior Driven Development - BDD

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an extension of TDD that focuses on the behavior of the software from the perspective of stakeholders (e.g., business analysts, product owners). BDD emphasizes collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders to define and verify the desired behavior of the system through scenarios written in a human-readable language.
BDD Process:
1.	Define Behavior: Describe the behavior of the system using scenarios written in a structured language like Gherkin (Given-When-Then format).
2.	Automate Scenarios: Write automated tests that implement the scenarios defined in the previous step.
3.	Run Tests: Execute the automated tests to verify that the system behaves as expected.
4.	Refactor and Iterate: Refactor code as needed and iterate on writing new scenarios and tests.
Benefits of BDD:
* Common Understanding: Helps create a shared understanding of requirements and behavior among team members.
* Focus on Business Value: Aligns development efforts with business goals and user expectations.
* Early Detection of Issues: Clarifies requirements early, reducing misunderstandings and rework.
* Documentation: Scenarios serve as living documentation of system behavior.
